       - High purity, stable               - Approximate concentration        - Use clean glassware
       - e.g., Na₂CO₃, K₂Cr₂O₇             - e.g., HCl, NaOH
       - Calculated exactly                - Requires standardization
       - Directly prepared                 - Use titration method

                               [ Preparation Steps ]
                                    |
           - Calculate required amount (N = Eq wt / L)
           - Weigh accurately
           - Dissolve in distilled water
           - Transfer to volumetric flask
           - Make up the volume
           - Shake and label

                        |
             [ Standardization (for Secondary) ]
                        |
        - Use titration against primary standard
        - Apply formula: N₁V₁ = N₂V₂
        - Record exact concentration
