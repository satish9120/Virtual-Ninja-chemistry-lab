Procedure:


Part A: Preparation of a Standard Solution (Primary Standard Example: Sodium Carbonate – Na₂CO₃)
Objective:
To prepare 250 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) standard solution.

Materials and Apparatus:
Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) – primary standard

Distilled water

Digital/analytical balance

Weighing boat or watch glass

Beaker (250 mL or larger)

Glass rod (for stirring)

250 mL volumetric flask

Funnel

Wash bottle

Dropper

Labeling materials (marker, label)

Steps:
Calculate the required mass of Na₂CO₃:

Weigh the exact amount (2.65 g) of anhydrous sodium carbonate using an analytical balance.

Transfer the solid into a 250 mL beaker using a clean funnel.

Add about 100 mL of distilled water to the beaker and stir with a glass rod until the solid completely dissolves.

Transfer the solution into a 250 mL volumetric flask using a funnel. Use distilled water to rinse the beaker and funnel, adding the rinsings to the flask.

Dilute the solution in the flask with distilled water up to the calibration mark. Use a dropper to add the last few drops carefully.

Stopper the flask and invert it several times to ensure thorough mixing.

Label the flask with the solution name, concentration, date, and your initials.

Part B: Preparation of a Reagent Solution (Example: 0.1 M Hydrochloric Acid – HCl)
Caution: HCl is corrosive. Wear gloves and work in a fume hood.
Steps:
Calculate the required volume of concentrated HCl:

Concentrated HCl = ~37% w/w, density ≈ 1.19 g/mL

Molarity ≈ 12 M

Use a pipette to carefully measure 2.08 mL of concentrated HCl.

Add the acid slowly into a beaker containing about 100 mL of distilled water (not the other way around). Stir carefully.

Transfer the solution to a 250 mL volumetric flask and rinse the beaker into the flask as well.

Dilute to the mark with distilled water, then stopper and mix well.

Label the solution with name, concentration, date, and initials.

Final Notes:
Always follow the safety rules for handling chemicals.

Use distilled or deionized water only.

Use glassware that is clean and dry.

Standard solutions may need to be standardized before use if made from secondary standards.
