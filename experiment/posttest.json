    "question": "What is a standard solution in chemistry?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A solution that changes color",
      "B": "A solution of unknown concentration",
      "C": "A solution with a known and fixed concentration",
      "D": "A solution that evaporates quickly"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A standard solution has a known and fixed concentration, used in titrations and quantitative analysis for accurate measurements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a suitable primary standard substance?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl)",
      "B": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)",
      "C": "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)",
      "D": "Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is stable, pure, and does not absorb moisture, making it ideal for use as a primary standard."

    "question": "How many grams of NaCl are needed to prepare 1 liter of 0.1 M NaCl solution? (Molar mass = 58.44 g/mol)",
    "options": {
      "A": "0.584 g",
      "B": "5.84 g",
      "C": "58.4 g",
      "D": "1.0 g"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To prepare 0.1 M solution: 0.1 mol × 58.44 g/mol = 5.844 g ≈ 5.84 g of NaCl is required in 1 liter of solution."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is NaOH not used as a primary standard reagent?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It is not soluble in water",
      "B": "It is too expensive",
      "C": "It absorbs moisture and CO₂ from the air",
      "D": "It reacts with plastic containers"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "NaOH is hygroscopic and absorbs both moisture and carbon dioxide from air, making it difficult to weigh accurately for standard solutions."
