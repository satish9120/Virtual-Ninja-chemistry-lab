      "question": "A 0.1N solution of HCl was standardized against sodium carbonate. The titration required 25.4 mL of HCl to reach the endpoint with 0.134g Na₂CO₃. What is the exact normality of the HCl? (MW Na₂CO₃ = 106 g/mol)",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct calculation: meq Na₂CO₃ = 0.134g/(106 g/mol ÷ 2) = 0.002528 meq; N HCl = meq/volume = 0.002528/0.0254 L = 0.0994 N",
        "b": "This would be the approximate value without considering exact measurements.",
        "c": "This might result from miscalculating the equivalent weight.",
