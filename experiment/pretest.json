        "a": "Standard solutions are prepared with known concentrations to serve as references in quantitative analysis.",
        "b": "Standard solutions are not used for cleaning purposes.",

      "question": "Which of the following is essential when preparing a primary standard?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High purity (99.9% or higher)",
        "b": "Bright color for visibility",
        "c": "Low molecular weight only",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Primary standards must be of exceptionally high purity.",

      "question": "What is the proper way to prepare a standard solution by dilution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Measure the solute carefully and dilute to the mark in a volumetric flask",
        "b": "Add arbitrary amounts of solute and solvent",
        "c": "Mix concentrated solutions with water in a beaker",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Volumetric flasks provide precise measurement for standard preparation.",
        "b": "Arbitrary measurements won't give accurate concentrations.",
        "c": "Beakers don't provide precise volume measurement.",

      "question": "Why is it important to standardize some solutions before use?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To determine their exact concentration",
        "b": "To change their chemical composition",
        "c": "To make them more concentrated",
        "d": "To remove all impurities"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Standardization establishes the precise concentration of a solution.",
        "b": "The chemical composition typically remains unchanged.",
        "c": "Standardization doesn't necessarily increase concentration.",
        "d": "While impurities may affect standardization, removal isn't the main goal."
