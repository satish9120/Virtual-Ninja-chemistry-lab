        "a": "Volumetric flasks provide precise measurement for standard preparation.",
        "b": "Arbitrary measurements won't give accurate concentrations.",
        "c": "Beakers don't provide precise volume measurement.",
        "d": "Evaporation would concentrate, not dilute, a solution."

      "question": "Why is it important to standardize some solutions before use?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To determine their exact concentration",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Standardization establishes the precise concentration of a solution.",
        "b": "The chemical composition typically remains unchanged.",
        "c": "Standardization doesn't necessarily increase concentration.",
        "d": "While impurities may affect standardization, removal isn't the main goal."

    "question": "What is a standard solution?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A solution with unknown concentration",
      "B": "A saturated solution",
      "C": "A solution of known and fixed concentration",
      "D": "A colored solution"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A standard solution is one whose concentration is accurately known and remains stable. It is used in titration and quantitative analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following compounds is most suitable for preparing a primary standard solution?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)",
      "B": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl)",
      "C": "Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)",
      "D": "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sodium carbonate is a primary standard because it is pure, stable, has a high molar mass, and does not absorb moisture from the air. Acids like HCl are not suitable because they are volatile or hygroscopic."

  {
    "question": "What is the correct method to prepare 1 liter of 0.1 M NaCl solution?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dissolve 0.1 g of NaCl in water",
      "B": "Dissolve 5.84 g of NaCl in water and make up to 1 liter",
      "C": "Dissolve 0.0584 g of NaCl in 100 mL water",
      "D": "Add NaCl until water tastes salty"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To prepare 1 L of 0.1 M NaCl solution, you need 0.1 moles of NaCl. Molar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol. So, 0.1 × 58.44 = 5.844 g ≈ 5.84 g."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is NaOH not used as a primary standard substance?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It is too expensive",
      "B": "It is not water soluble",
      "C": "It is unstable and absorbs moisture and CO₂ from the air",
      "D": "It does not dissolve in alcohol"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "NaOH is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making it difficult to weigh accurately. Hence, it is not suitable as a primary standard."
