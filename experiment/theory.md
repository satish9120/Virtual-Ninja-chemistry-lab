# Theory

## 1. Introduction

In chemical analysis—particularly in quantitative and qualitative experiments—it is essential to use solutions of known concentration (*standard solutions*) and well-defined chemical reagents. Reliable results depend on the **accurate preparation and use** of these solutions.

## 2. Standard Solutions

A **standard solution** has a known concentration of solute. It is used in analyses like **titration**, **spectrophotometry**, and **chromatography**.

### a) Primary Standard Solutions

Prepared by dissolving a **pure, stable compound** in a known volume of solvent.

**Characteristics of a good primary standard:**
- High purity  
- Stable  
- Non-hygroscopic  
- High molar mass  
- Soluble in water

**Examples:**
- Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃)  
- Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP)  
- Oxalic acid (H₂C₂O₄·2H₂O)

### b) Secondary Standard Solutions

These **cannot be prepared accurately by weighing**, and are standardized by titrating against a primary standard.

**Examples:**
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)  
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  
- Potassium permanganate (KMnO₄)

## 3. Reagents

Reagents are chemicals used to detect, measure, or create substances in chemical reactions.

### Types:
- **Analytical Reagents (AR):** High purity, used for lab experiments  
- **Laboratory Reagents (LR):** Slightly lower purity  
- **Volumetric Reagents:** Must be standardized, used in titrations  

**Proper preparation includes:**
- Accurate measurement  
- Use of distilled/deionized water  
- Safe mixing  
- Proper labeling

## 4. Calculations

**Molarity (M)** is calculated as:


To prepare a standard solution:

### Example:
To prepare 250 mL of 0.1 M NaCl:

- Molar mass = 58.44 g/mol  
- Moles = 0.1 × 0.25 = 0.025 mol  
- Mass = 0.025 × 58.44 = **1.46 g**

## 6. Importance of Proper Preparation

- **Accuracy:** Required for titration/instrumental analysis  
- **Reproducibility:** Enables consistent results  
- **Calibration:** Standard solutions calibrate instruments  
- **Quality Assurance:** Especially important in pharmaceuticals and food industries

## 7. Storage and Labeling

Prepared solutions should be:

- Stored in **clean, labeled containers**
- Dated and initialed by the **preparer**
- Protected from **light and contamination**
